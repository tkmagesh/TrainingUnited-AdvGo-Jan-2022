Noticable features of Go
    1. higher order functions
        functions as data
            a. can assign a function to a variable
            b. can pass a function as an argument
            c. can return a function as a return value

    2. interface
    3. goroutines
        Go is a language built for concurrency
            language features
                go, chan (data type), <- (chan operator), select, range,
                sync package

    4. error handling


Concurrency

Thread T = new System.Threading.Thread(fn);
T.Start();

Things that should NOT be assumed in concurrent programming
    1. Never assume the sequence of execution of the goroutines
    2. Never assume the time taken for a goroutine to complete its task

To detect race conditions
    go run -race demo-04.go 

        OR

    go build -race demo-04.go
    ./demo-04
